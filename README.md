# OriginalBlueF3X's Profile
- Hi, I'm Spencer, welcome to my profile

## I program
- No, really?
- I'm currently on the programming team for [team2393](https://team2393.com) and would you look at that, it's the website I made
- (Yes, it's bad, as are all things that are a WIP)

- I know Java, JavaScript, Lua, LuaU, C++, Python, HTML/CSS (you be the judge of how good my skills are)
- Fun fact: I know 7 total programming languages, not fluently but good enough to be constantly learning!
- Fun fact #2: I'm entirely self-taught. Not a dime was spent for me to learn any language; Guess what? You can too!

# Self-Taught, you say?
- Yes, really. Fully self-taught.
- Which is why I dont know most of the programming lingo, but usually I dont need to.

## How?
- Mostly, reading docs, tinkering with youtube tutorials and their code.
- and a lot.. A LOT of console.log()-ing
